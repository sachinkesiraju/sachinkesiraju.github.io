        <br><br>
        List of daring projects, ideas and ventures I feel I have a strong point of view on. Please <a href="mailto:me@sachinkesiraju.com">reach out</a> if you are keen to pursue any of these - I would be happy to discuss detailed strategy, co-found or help fund the right team.

        <br><br>

        <ul class="writing-list">
          <li>
            <b>AI-native Conde Nast</b>: <i>accelerationist media conglomerate</i><br>
            <p>Public markets undervalue media (trading ~0.7x revenue = valued as negative growth). AI improves content generation but most existing cos are too big/writer heavy to integrate in meaningful way. Someone will accelerate autonomous media companies & lifestyle (not news) is the right start. Limit staff to only strategically essential: seasoned ad exec, strong EIC, couple great investigative/scene reporters. Invest in engineering right cultural data pipeline & use AI to generate 95% of writing, audio & video content to growth hack every channel. At the right scale, unlock ad biz at relative net zero cost. Rinse and repeat across new verticals.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Agartha Expedition</b>: <i>journey to the center of the earth</i><br>
            <p>In the past, great scientists drew inspiration from mythology and the occult. Today, science is used as antonym to figurative myth. Star Trek aestheticized development in space travel, what inspires mythical exploration again (search for Atlantis, origins of Serpent Mound)? "Agartha" / "Shambala" is a recurring trope across cultures & unifying cause. Crowdfund and publicize expeditions to explore mythologized “portals” to the advanced world in the Earth’s hollow center. Think “National Treasure” as Youtube series. If govts intervene, lean into conspiracy and rally as research institute offering grants to explore truth in fiction.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>IKEA for maximalist archival furniture</b>: <i>eclectic design made accessible to the masses</i><br>
            <p>IKEA is responsible for Scandinavian design hegemony around the world. There’s a growing market for archival (Victorian/Art Deco etc) furniture but pieces are insurmountably expensive and hard to source. Most culture-forward urbanites want their Pinterest interior design boards but at attainable prices. The right team (large manufacturing exp) replicating popular archival designs at scale (with certain compromises) could unlock a new premium market (Mario Bellini couches, Dorothy Draper dining sets, Eames lounge chairs <$1k). Bonus if modular & easily assembleable. Similar opportunity in archival couture dresses.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>8sleep for in-home spas</b>: <i>quantified wellness</i><br>
            <p>Most spas suck and are overpriced. There are also more high-performance professionals willing to invest in consistent (and quantifiable) wellness improvements. I imagine a red light sauna the size of an office phone booth, designed tastefully enough to have displayed in a West Village apt living room (like a Peloton). Equip with basic biometric tracking: resting heart rate, lung capacity, hydration estimates.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>New "Computers"</b>: <i>adapt new computing interfaces</i><br>
            <p>AI & cloud software change how we use computers for work & play. There’s a good chance the modern computer is symbolically equivalent to the Blackberry, ready to be disrupted by new computing interfaces. Rather than compete with Apple for the average consumer, think this starts uniquely designed for specific professionals. Perhaps new Bloomberg Terminals? Or new stenographs? <a href="https://mythic.computer" target="_blank">Mythic</a> is an excellent start to this inquiry.</p>
